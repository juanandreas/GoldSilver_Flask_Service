Welcome to my Web-Scraper for gold and silver historical data.

    -   fetch.py is a program to fetch the historical prices and dates of gold and silver from these 2 URLs:

        https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold-historical-data
        https://www.investing.com/commodities/silver-historical-data

        and store them locally in a csv file.

    -   app.py is a Flask API that Create an endpoint that will accept HTTP GET with the below arguments, 
        and returns a json time series, mean and variance computed over the specified period.

        * start_date - required (iso format like 2017-05-10)
        * end_date - required (iso format like 2017-05-22)
        * commodity_type - required (gold, silver)

        GET request example with curl:
        curl 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/commodity?start_date=2019-04-04&end_date=2019-05-03&commodity_type=gold'


To create data locally, pulled from the two URLs above:

    $ python3 fetch.py

To run Flask server:

    $ python3 app.py

In the case that programs do not run because of dependencies:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
